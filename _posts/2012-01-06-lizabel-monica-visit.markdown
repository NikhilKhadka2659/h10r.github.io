First, I still can’t believe that Cuba does not have proper Internet for its people. In face of the events like Arab Spring, I thought everybody in the world has at least basic Internet access by now. Unbelievable.

As I already pointed out in class, I would recommend the people to set up mesh networks. On the one hand, this may enable them to bridge the gap to real Internet access, but on the other hand, it will also enable the people, who are part of that network, to communicate safely and without the government listening.

Moncia and her friends should also install some USB dead drops in Cuba, if they have not done that already. USB dead drops is a really nice art project by Aram Bartholl from Berlin [http://vimeo.com/16620712].

What I loved most about the talk was the really amazing example. What I did not like was the timeline format, as it focused too much on the timely order of the events. I would have preferred to have the projects presented in relation to their significance. Monica should have been more self-confident anyway, as she appears to have a lot to say. Yet did see merely provide a list of names, which I obviously might check out myself. But it would have been much better, if she had provided more examples.

A good example she gave were the ready-mades of state security files that some artist’s presented at the Biennale. But she should have provided much more. Especially as she could have told us more about the cultural context of the works.

Regarding the film “For the first time”, I really loved to see the faces of the people watching their first movie. They were so amazed and happy, which was really moving. My anticipation was not met, though, as my first association regarding “watching film for the first time” was of course “L'Arrivée d'un train en gare de La Ciota” by the Lumière Brothers and the urban legend, that the people screamed and ran to the back of the room. Technically, I totally loved the style of the documentary, which reminded me of many sixties music documentaries (especially that one about Jimi Hendrix and Woodstock). 

I think it is hard to define, what social media is really about. Obvious parts of the social media puzzle are of course social networks, blogs, podcasts, and sites with user-generated content like YouTube or Wikipedia. But as we are not only talking about social media, but actually about social media art, we have to define what media art is first. My personal definition of media art is very much inspired by Frieder Nake. According to this definition, something considered media art must not be immediate, but conveyed by a medium. Like algorithmic visual art, where algorithms are executed to produce the artwork. With that definition in mind, most of the art and poetry shown as examples in the talk would not be what I consider media art. I would rather describe it as social media-aided art, as the Internet obviously has a huge impact on the artists and how they (inter-)operate.

The idea of Cuba Fake News really reminded me about the American news satire organization The Onion, as they share a common approach. Ironically, people frequently take the Onion serious with little media literacy, as the site Literally Unbelievable [http://literallyunbelievable.org/] demonstrates. As the people in Cuba have little exposure to new media and therefore little media literacy, I wonder if Lizabel Monica has experienced similar stories. As she hosts her blog with Google Blogger, which provides a pretty good PageRank and visibility in search result, her stories may show up frequently while googling and confuse people, which is subversive and great.

I think it is remarkable and courageous to make art facing physical harm and punishment.
