I really enjoyed the visit of Nick Montfort and his workshop.

Regarding the workshop, I already knew a fair deal of Python. Nevertheless, it was interesting to see how a professor from MIT organizes his introduction to programming for non-programmers (learning and teaching programming has been an issue which really fascinates me for some reason). 

With regards to the content, I want to record his thoughts on negation. Unlike in fiction, where a negation is important in terms of the actions and consequences, in poetry, Montfort regards a negated statement as equal to a non-negated statement, as both introduce the idea and express its importance. 

Thanks to the workshop, I came up the idea of coding a twitter bot, which updates my personal twitter status randomly using the same technique Montfort uses to create poetry. I would define a set of interesting activities, which are then posted at random times (I might pick up this idea as my final project).

I really liked Nick’s presentation, both in terms of content and style. I also liked the fact that he showed so many examples. He was presenting in a personal, entertaining fashion.

His project “Ad Verbum” and the whole concept of interactive fiction is especially interesting to me. I think it was a wonderful combination of an interesting interfaces and some really good poetry. 

His description of the Electric Literature Organization reminded me of the discussion in the book regarding the term “sound art”. He said, that the ELO is “no literary movement, but a variety of people”. This is also similar to how Lizabel Monica described the digital poetry scene in Cuba.

Also interesting is what Nick said about potential literature. He had the notion, that the algorithm itself only represents “potential literature”. That means, it can be used to create literature, but it is not literature in itself. He also referenced the n+7 method used by Ourvoir de Literature Potential (Oulipo), who replaced each noun in a text with the noun seven entries away from it in the dictionary.

The talk also raised very interesting questions. For instance, what if somebody took a specific Processing sketch, exchanged the words and presented it as his work. Who would be credited and what is the important part of a work - the algorithm, the words or both?

I also loved Montfort’s remark on the postmodern nature of programming. On the one hand, as I as a programmer myself know how much code is found on the web and adapted. On the other hand, as computer science itself is entirely postmodern and has no content on it’s own, but rather applies mathematical knowledge to a variety of different topics and sciences.

Especially interesting to me was Montfort’s discussion of how to judge the aesthetic quality of electronic literature and if the process or the result is more important to this quality. Many visual algorithmic artists from the early days, like Frieder Nake and Roman Verostko, regarded the process of creating their paintings as more important than the paintings themself. For Montfort, both the results and the code appear to be equally important. 
Montfort also utilizes the code itself in an artistic sense. Especially with ppg256, where the title refers to the limitation to 256 characters as well as to the use of the rather hard to read programming language Perl (which is “write-only”, as Nick put it).
An ironic side note was that people need a title to recognize poetry.
