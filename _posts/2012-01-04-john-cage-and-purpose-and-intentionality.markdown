#### Can you remove purpose or intentionality in music?  In what ways does Cage attempt to do this?   

You can of course remove purpose or intentionality in music. But the more important question is, if you will still consider it music, then. This depends on your personal definition of what music is. Cage’s definition of music is very wide and includes all kinds of sound and noises. Moreover and exemplified by his answers to the various questions regarding timbre, dynamics, themes, I don’t have the feeling that he actually can remove purpose and intentionality entirely. But I am sure he tries not to add purpose and intentionality. This is made clear by his statement that there are no themes, as it is “not a question of having something to say”. But his approach of organizing sound and his attempt to avoid intentionality is intentional itself and thus prevents him from achieving his goal. 
Moreover, he declines the idea that “experimental” music has purpose, saying “No purposes. Sounds.” So he does not remove purpose or intentionality, but rather ignores them, as they are not part of his definition or idea of “music”.

I would rather describe Cage’s “music” as sound art, although this implies that my definition is strongly influenced by Beethoven, Mahler, and Schönberg. And all of them had purpose or intentionality in music. Even Arnold Schönberg had very strong themes, just consider his brilliant work “A Survivor from Warsaw”.  Therefore, I prefer to regard Cage as an artist, as the main goal of art, at least to my understanding, has always been to extend the means of expression. Picasso is one of the most important artists of the 20th century and he augmented what can be expressed in paintings. Picasso for example introduced abstract, foreign faces instead of realistic depictions of people. 
Cage’s point of view is influenced by his notion that there are always at least two sounds: the nerve’s systematic operation and the blood’s circulation. This is an interesting thought and it can inspire you to think about silence, so it is procreative and generative from a creative perspective. 
On the other hand, I don’t like this in connection to a definition of music, as it is too phenomenological, as it focuses on specific parts like sounds and noises and disregards what is really important in music. After all, it is the sum of the tones and their arrangement that music is all about. This is also the big difference between music and sound art for me.

#### How are Merzbow and Cage (specifically 4’33”) similar? In what ways are they different (think in terms of intentionality)?  

The most remarkable quote about Merzbow’s music is the idea, that “the distinction between noise, sound and music (...) [is] left to come apart in Akita’s hands.” Akita is said to amplify the “sound spectrum.” This, I think, is the next step after Cage, who with his piece 4’33” and his entire theory of sound, mainly focuses on what sound can be heard while listening to silence. While Cage is the first to encourage us to be silent and just listen to the sounds around us, Akita is the one who uses technology to build noisy sounds with technology, going one step further than Cage. Merzbow focuses on “noise-making” and artificially creates new sounds, while Cage wants us to listen closely to the sounds that are already there. 

I would disagree, that McLuhan’s “medium is the message” does not apply to this kind of “music” or rather sound art, as the art is focusing strictly on itself and its basic component. I think, that although the music itself does not have a purpose or intentionality, it still has meaning in a broader sense. As concrete art, it does certainly not transport a message. But on a formal level, it definitely has an intention, although this is not necessarily reflected in the music, but rather in the theory, premise or background story. This is important and applies to works like 4”33’ as well as to Merzbow’s.

#### Based on the views Cage has expressed in the readings as well as the material presented in class, how might Cage go about making choices in his music?   

In the text Cage discusses his use of “chance operations”, using both formal systems like the I Ching as well as self-reflection on his imperfections. But the most striking comment on his choices might be this answer: “By not giving a thought”. Even with this information in mind, I think it is really hard to answer this question. On the one hand, as Cage apparently put a lot of thought in his music and he has a very strong idea about what to say. On the other hand, he does not convey his message in traditional ways, that is via music, but rather by what I describe as theory, premise or background story. Therefore, I think that Cage might think of all these factors beforehand and then find a way to implement these ideas. The development of 4”33’, for example, could be more like designing a board game, where you set up the rules and the scope of action, rather than the actual action.
