My idea is based on the underwater sound called “Bloop”. “Bloop” was an extremely powerful ultra-low frequency sound, which the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) detected in 1997. The fascinating thing about “Bloop” is the fact that it was registered by several different sensor at a range of over 5,000km (3,100 miles). This means, that the sound is much louder  than anything any known animal in the sea could possibly produce. In pop culture, this is often regarded as a sign for the existence of sea monsters or even HP Lovecraft's Cthulhu.

In Kraken & Kaos, a group of players act together as a team, guarding an island in the sea. On this island, a group of people lives. The people need to be protected. This can be done by moving them on the island. Moreover, the players can set up walls and anti-sea monster warfare, protecting the people with different strategies. My design goal is to make people interact with each other in a thrilling way, while having the ability to create something. The thrilling element is implemented by the fact that some players are not only part of the island defense committee, but also undercover helpers of the sea monster. The game is turn-based. First, all players in the game discuss their strategy of where to move their people and how to arm the island. After that, all players secretly playing for the monster team decide where to move the monster and whether to attack the island or not. Any attack will cost health energy, but it might pay off in terms of victims, which increase the energy of the monster. 

The most exciting part of this game is the discussion of the island defense committee, as everybody is suspicious and might be part of the conspiracy, while on the other hand the group has to act in effort to save the people. The game is over, when either all people or the sea monster is dead (no energy left).

The main idea is very similar to most tower defense games. But in this case, the danger is invisible. The social interaction is inspired by the popular french party game “Les loups-garous de Thiercelieux”, where a town is defending themselves against a group of werewolves among them.

The game is a multiplayer game, where people communicate in Person, via text-chat and/or Skype. I think text-chat might be the most thrilling experience though, as it is the most ambiguous form of communication. The gameplay should be pretty similar to games like “Age of Empires”, enabling the group to build anti-sea monster warfare. 

I would like to implement this as a server-based online game, with a small server written in Ruby on Rails and an client in Processing.js.
In a physical version, a storyteller, a map of an island and some token are sufficient. The storyteller has to  makes sure to play out the movement of the sea monster without the entire committee noticing.

The audience includes any social human being. Age does not matter that much, although some basic acting skill is a plus. Generally, any child able to lie is able to play the game. Playing the game might augment children’s knowledge of human nature and advocate their critical thinking skills.
