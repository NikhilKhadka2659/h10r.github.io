The Center of the Creative and Performing Arts seems to have been a very innovative place with a vision and many people who were curious and passionate about new music. For Cage, just like for many other people, this must have been very appealing. One of the aims of the Center was to close the gap between performer and composer. This is also one of Cage’s main themes, as he for example left room for interpretation with his graphical notations, thereby encouraging the performers to add their interpretation to the works. 

One of the Center’s aims was to provide time and freedom to practice and experiment, covering a wide variety of musical topics and techniques from improvisation to installations to computer music. Another important aim of the Center was to enable each musician to “find his or her artitistic path”. This must have appealed to Cage, who himself did not just follow Schönberg’s advice, but found his own musical voice.

Another important thing about the Center is the security it provided to inexperienced musicians. While many people are surely motivated to find new ways of musical expression, most do not have the chance to try them, as they have to make money to make a living. Making money almost always demands some sacrifices, like commissions or teaching. The center did provide a reliable paycheck while encouraging people to be innovative. It also aimed for the long run and encouraged real innovation, while commissions often force musician’s to satisfy trends.

Another really important feature about the Center in Buffalo is the role of the media, especially the press. They helped spread the word about the music and even turned the Creative Assistants into celebrities, as the text says.

Cage was talented in terms of social networking and in many places he visited, a group of people, who were influenced by his ideas, formed. Therefore, the idea of a group must have been very appealing to him. The Creative Associates worked as a group and inspired, encouraged and helped each other, just like Cage did with many of his friends. 

Working at the center was also a big commitment, as the people had to relocate to Buffalo to work with the Center. But this created a unique spirit and made the group working possible, as they had a defined place to meet. Cage was tied to New York City, just like his collaborators Merce Cunningham and David Tudor, so he knew the advantage of working together in the same place. While New York City is certainly an inspiring and interesting city, it might not be the best place to invent completely new music, as there are so many influences. Moreover, I think it can be pretty hard to be heard in New York City, as the musical scene is so much bigger than in Buffalo.
