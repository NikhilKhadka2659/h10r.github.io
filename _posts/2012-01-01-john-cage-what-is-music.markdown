Cage and others liberated music from tradition and connected it with dance and performance art, which made it more expressive, but also very different from traditional music. He is also a good example for the art of the twentieth century, as almost everything changed and most of the conventional rules did not apply to this new art any more. In his “Preface to Notations”, Cage describes music as the “only international language”, which is a wonderful comment on the nature of music.

For Cage, music was just sounds and these sounds did not have to originate from traditional music. He for example proofed in “Water Walk” that every household item could be used to create music. “Music Of Changes” showed that even chance operations could lead to musical pieces, as long as you have a rule set to map the chance operations to musical parameters.

After World War II, many composers were looking for radically new means of expression. Meanwhile, the concept of art itself was challenged by radical artist like Marcel Duchamp, who broadened the definition of what art is. All this influenced the idea of what music is to John Cage. His music marks a very interesting point in music history. Cage questions many of our preconceived ideas of music – especially materiality and intentionality. Considering music history, Hindemith and especially Schönberg challenged the harmonic foundations of music. Schönberg’s dodecaphony and serialism in general paved the way for Cage. But Cage did not simply continued what Schönberg did. While Schönberg mostly challenged our concept of harmony, Cage also challenged how we think about the process of composition (chance operations), instruments (“Water Walk”) and materiality (“4’33””).

In his text “The Future of Music - Credo”, Cage defines his art as the “organization of sound”. He explores a variety of instruments and materials to create his music. In “4”33’”, he even makes silence the material of his music. The fundamental key to understand Cage’s concept of music is the story of the anechoic chamber, where Cage realized that there is no silence but always noise of some kind. Equally important is the utilization of indeterminacy in his piece, which enabled him to remove intentionality form his music.

In the 20th century, many composers of new music altered well-known instruments to make new noises (for example the prepared piano by Cage). Moreover, the traditional boundaries between specific art forms blurred, as composer like Cage did many things, which were quite similar to the performance art in Fluxus. 

Music was not only about melodies and sounds anymore, but became a way of artistic expression, equally important as painting or dance. This of course had a big impact on the musician’s who played the pieces Cage composed. Cage did his experiments with virtuosity and challenged musicians to play especially hard pieces of music. He also introduced room for interpretation with his graphic notations, as it was not always completely clear and definite how to play his music.
