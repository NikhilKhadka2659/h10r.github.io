I like the idea of synergies between art and technology and I do believe that everybody nowadays benefits from technology. Not only, but also, regarding the art world. I also agree with Cage when he says “all technology must move toward” to what he describes as an “identification with nature” in “complete mystery”. This really reminds me of the Tangible User Interfaces. Invented at the MIT Media Lab by Hiroshi Ishii and his Tangible Media Group, Tangible User Interfaces are an alternative to traditional human computer interaction. Their goal is it to make technology tangible and invisible, moving technology away from personal computers, which you use with a mouse and keyboard, towards seemingless and ubiquitous computing.

I also agree with Cage that there is an audience for computer art. His remark, that the computer turns us into artists, has been completely verified by history. What he does not consider are movements like the algorithmic art or the generative art movement (http://www.creativeapplications.net/), where technology is not just means, but an end in itself. This also goes far beyond most contemporary art, which is just art with computer assistance.

I do not share Cage’s opinion that art and TV are “equally tedious”, but I like the idea of art being socialized. Today, art, especially in terms of design, is omniscient and just everywhere you look. With the advent of the MP3 and the iPod, the notion, that “concerts celebrate the fact that concerts are no longer necessary” is completely right and proved. While we don’t need concerts to listen to music, people still love to go to concerts, because it is a special, unique and social event. That’s the kind of “auratic perception” Walter Benjamin is talking about.   As I consider myself on the border between computer science and art, I feel sad on the remark that conversations between artists and engineers did not work for Cage. Maybe today, as more computer scientists are engaged in art, a conversation might work? I hope so.

In his “Preface to Notations”, Cage remarks that memorizing written music is an Occidental practice, while passing it on from person to person is Oriental. Moreover, writing music down makes art a property and thereby part of the political practice. This also holds true to this day, as copyright is a big issue, especially as everything is digital and so easily copied nowadays. Cage addresses this implication of electronic technology, too. 

A beautiful remark is the idea that music is the “only true international language”. 
I also like Cage’s approach to have manuscript pages, which leave the composer’s hand. This renunciation is a really nice comment on the art of the twentieth century, as almost everything changed and most of the rules and the conventional wisdom did not apply to art anymore.
