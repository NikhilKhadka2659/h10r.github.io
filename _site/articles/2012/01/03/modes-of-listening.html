      <h4 id="what-are-the-three-modes-of-listening-and-how-do-they-differ-from-each-other">What are the three modes of listening, and how do they differ from each other?</h4>

<p>Michel Chion introduces three modes of listening: Causal Listening, Semantic Listening and Reduced Listening. Causal Listening is gathering information about the objects in the world through listening. Here, the focus lies on the cause of a sound. In contrast, Semantic Listening deals with encoded information, which is transmitted by noises and which has to be decoded by the listener to make sense. Language is the most common occurrence of Semantic Listening. In Language, pitch and subtle differences in the sound do not matter, as long as they are unimportant to pronunciation. In Semantic Listening, you don’t listen to acoustical properties, but you rather look for certain differences and oppositions.</p>

<p>The third mode of listening is Reduced Listening. Here, the sound itself is emphasized. The cause of a sound is not important. In Reduced Listening, the listener is encouraged to pay attention to sonic textures, masses, and velocities. The goal of Reduced Listening is to perceive the inherent traits of a sound and to study the raw materials themselves.</p>

<h4 id="schaeffer-refers-to-reduced-listening-as-the-most-advanced-state-of-listening--why-is-this-mode-of-listening-the-most-challenging--why-might-achieving-this-mode-of-listening-be-particularly-difficult-for-electronic-music">Schaeffer refers to reduced listening as the most advanced state of listening.  Why is this mode of listening the most challenging?  Why might achieving this mode of listening be particularly difficult for electronic music?</h4>

<p>First of all, we are very used to Causal Listening. In terms of evolution, determining the cause of a sound was important to survive. Therefore, we are programmed to automatically relate sounds to certain concepts or events. Overcoming this is a big challenge, as there is automatically a connection between something you see and something you hear at the same time. This process is called synchresis. Sound design utilizes synchresis and encourages Causal Listening. Video only works, as the brain automatically connects the sounds heard with the images seen. 
But as said in the text, this connection can be broken by repetition, which is a very good way to remove the cause from the sound itself. If you hear something over and over again, you can start to focus on the sound itself.</p>

<p>The “Étude aux chemins de fer” is an interesting mixture of different sounds related to trains and train stations. At least to me, it always generates pictures of travelling trains in my head, although I am aware that this is not what Schaeffer was trying to accomplish. But even if I try really heard, I can’t stop myself from picturing how, for instance, the train wheels scrape against the rail. While I still relate single sounds to specific objects and events, I regard the music and it’s progression as independent from the cause of the sound. That means, I do not connect the sounds to a story like “a driving train drives into a city, stops at a train station and lets the passengers deboard”, but I rather listen to it as it is.</p>

<p>I think Chion is right, that it is really hard to describe these phenomena using normal musical terminology. Schaeffer’s “Traite des objets musicaux” is a very elaborate system to classify sounds and I used it briefly in a sound design class I took in Bremen. But it can’t capture all aspects of sound.</p>

<p>Achieving the mode of Reduced Listening might be the easiest using musical instruments, which don’t have as many connotations as real life sounds. If you attribute a cause to a sound from a musical instrument, you mostly relate it to the musician playing the instrument. 
But I don’t think achieving the mode of Reduced Listening is much harder with electronic music in general. If you think about synthesizer and for example frequency modulation synthesis (FM synthesis), it is abstract and does not relate to things in the real world. Therefore, I think it is as easy to achieve Reduced Listening in electronic music as it is in classical music. Especially as musical instruments are also sometimes connected to certain causes (like in Prokofiev’s “Peter and the Wolf”). Reduced Listening is of course the goal of musique concrète, as you remove the cause of a sound to use it as your musical material. But even in musique concrète, you can’t completely remove the cause of sound. Schaeffer for example names his piece “Études de chemin de fer”, which points the listener to the fact that he is using train sounds as his musical material and which makes Reduced Listening harder.</p>
